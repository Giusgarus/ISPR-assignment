# ISPR 24/25 - Assignments

This repository contains the assignments for the ISPR course (Intelligente system for Pattern Recognition) for the academic year 2024/2025. Each folder corresponds to one of the four assignments given during the course.

## Repository Structure

- `Assignment1 track 4/`: Edge detection.  
- `Assignment2 track 4/`: Bayesin Network.
- `Assignment3/`: Brief description of the third assignment.
- `Assignment4/`: Brief description of the fourth assignment.

## Assignment Details

### Assignment 1: Edge Detection with Convolution Filters

**Description:**  
Implement the convolution of a set of edge detection filters with an image and apply it to at least three images of your choice from the [dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Appliances+energy+prediction#). Implement Roberts, Prewitt, and Sobel filters (see here, Section 5.2, for a reference) and compare the results (it is sufficient to do it visually). You should not use library functions for performing the convolution or generating the Sobel filter. Implement your own and show the code!

**Instructions:**  
1. Select at least three images from the provided [dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Appliances+energy+prediction#).  
2. Implement the Roberts, Prewitt, and Sobel edge detection filters from scratch. Avoid using library functions for convolution or filter generation.  
3. Apply each filter to the selected images and visually compare the results.  
4. Document your implementation process, including the code and visual outputs, in a report or notebook.  
5. Submit your code and report by the specified deadline.

### Assignment 2: Bayesian Network Modeling and Sampling

**Description:**  
Implement a Bayesian Network (BN) comprising at least 10 nodes, all with binomial or multinomial distribution. Represent the BN with the data structures that you deem appropriate and in the programming language that you prefer. The BN should model some problem/process of your choice, so you are also free to define the topology according to your prior knowledge (just be ready to justify your choices). For instance, you can define a BN to represent a COVID diagnosis through a certain number of events/exams/symptoms: e.g. Cough, Cold, Fever, Breathing problems, Swab Exam, etc. Or you can model your daily routine: Wakeup, Coffee, Toilet, Study, Lunch, etc.

Once you have modelled the BN, also plug in the necessary local conditional probability tables. You can set the values of the probabilities following your own intuition on the problem (i.e., no need to learn them from data). Then run some episodes of Ancestral Sampling on the BN and discuss the results.

The assignment needs to be fully implemented by you, without using BN libraries.

**Instructions:**  
- Design and implement the Bayesian Network with at least 10 nodes.  
- Define the topology and justify your choices.  
- Populate the local conditional probability tables with intuitive values.  
- Perform Ancestral Sampling and analyze the results.  
- Provide a detailed explanation of your implementation and findings.
