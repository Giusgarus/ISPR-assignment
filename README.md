# ISPR 24/25 - Assignments

This repository contains the assignments for the ISPR course (Intelligente system for Pattern Recognition) for the academic year 2024/2025. Each folder corresponds to one of the four assignments given during the course.

## Repository Structure

- `Assignment1 track 4/`: Edge detection.  
- `Assignment2 rack 4/`: Bayesin Network.
- `Assignment3/`: Brief description of the third assignment.
- `Assignment4/`: Brief description of the fourth assignment.

## Assignment Details

### Assignment 1: [Title of Assignment 1]

**Description:**  
Implement the convolution of a set of edge detection filters with an image and apply it to at three images of your choice from the dataset. Implement Roberts, Prewitt and Sobel filters (see here, Section 5.2, for a reference) and compare the results (it is sufficient to do it visually).  You should not use the library functions for performing the convolution or to generate the Sobel filter. Implement your own and show the code!

### Assignment 2: [Title of Assignment 2]

**Description:**  
Implement a Bayesian Network (BN) comprising at least 10 nodes, all with binomial or multinomial distribution. Represent the BN with the data structures that you deem appropriate and in the programming language that you prefer. The BN should model some problem/process of your choice, so you are also free to define the topology according to your prior knowledge (just be ready to justify your choices). For instance, you can define a BN to represent a COVID diagnosis through a certain number of events/exams/symptoms: e.g. Cough, Cold, Fever, Breathing problems, Swab Exam, etc. Or you can model your daily routine: Wakeup, Coffee, Toilet, Study, Lunch, etc.
 
Once you have modelled the BN, also plug in the necessary local conditional probability tables. You can set the values of the probabilities following your own intuition on the problem (ie no need to learn them from data). Then run some episoded of Ancestral Sampling on the BN and discuss the results.

The assignment needs to be fully implemented by you, without using BN libraries.
